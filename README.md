# CSCI_651_Assignment1

## About this project
This project is implemented in JS. All the test cases provided by the professor have been converted to unit tests. We are using Mocha as the test framework. So we can run the unit test to verify the result.

All the test cases are in the `test` folder.
For question 7, the testing code is in the main.js. You can run the ```node main.js```
If you want to test custom test cases, You can add them in the main.js or add new cases in the test.js.

### install Node.js
As we mentioned at the beginning, we need to install Node.js to be able to run the test. Since we don't know which OS you are using, please check the document below to install the Node.js and npm.
